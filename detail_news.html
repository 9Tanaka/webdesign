        <h2>VTubers, Flags, Happi Coats and Plushies!</h2>

        <img src="img/News/new2.jpg" alt="VTuber Cosplay Gathering at Anime Expo 2025">

        <p><span class="firstword">Anime Expo 2025</span> witnessed one of the most vibrant VTuber community gatherings this year, as fans dressed in elaborate cosplays came together to celebrate their favorite virtual content creators. The event showcased the growing influence of VTuber culture in North America's largest anime convention.</p>

        <h3>A Merged Gathering of Passionate Fans</h3>

        <p>Two cosplay gatherings with the same theme were initially scheduled simultaneously, creating an exciting challenge for organizers and attendees alike. The first gathering was organized by Panako behind the AX Crossing area, while the second was coordinated by Raz.GG at the stairs under the awning on the corner of 15th Drive and Figueroa Street.</p>

        <p>In a show of community spirit, both organizing parties decided to merge their gatherings, meeting up at the stairs—the same venue that hosted last year's hololive Cosplay Gathering. This decision ensured that all VTuber fans could come together in one unified celebration, making it easier for everyone to participate and connect with fellow enthusiasts.</p>

        <h3>The Gathering Location</h3>

        <p>The chosen venue at Site #7, the stairs under the awning on the corner of 15th Drive and Figueroa Street, proved to be an ideal spot for the massive turnout. Fans gathered at Site #4 first around 6:30 pm before migrating together to Site #7, creating a spectacular procession of cosplayers through the convention grounds.</p>

        <p>The location's significance wasn't lost on veteran attendees—it was the same spot where the hololive Cosplay Gathering took place the previous year, adding a sense of tradition to this year's event.</p>

        <h3>A Sea of Colors and Creativity</h3>

        <p>The gathering was a visual feast, with attendees bringing flags, happi coats, and plushies representing their favorite VTubers. Cosplayers showcased impressive attention to detail in their outfits, bringing various VTuber characters to life. From hololive production members to NIJISANJI talents and independent VTubers, the diversity of representation was remarkable.</p>

        <p>The atmosphere was electric with excitement as fans met others who shared their passion. Many attendees carried custom-made props, light sticks, and banners, creating a colorful and energetic scene that captured the essence of VTuber fandom.</p>

        <h3>Special Performance: The Goon Squad</h3>

        <p>Adding to the excitement, a new wotagei team called the Goon Squad performed their routine after the main video recording concluded. Wotagei, the coordinated chanting and choreographed movements performed by fans during idol performances, has become an integral part of VTuber fan culture. The Goon Squad's performance demonstrated the community's dedication to supporting their favorite creators in traditional Japanese idol fashion.</p>

        <h3>Community Coordination and Spirit</h3>

        <p>The successful merger of two separate gatherings highlighted the VTuber community's collaborative spirit. Organizer Panako announced on social media: "A bit of plans have changed, we will be merging with the Vtuber cosplay gathering on site 7 (make it easier for everyone) hope to see you amazing peeps there!!!"</p>

        <p>This flexibility and willingness to work together ensured that the event maximized participation and created a more memorable experience for all attendees. The gathering served as a testament to the strong bonds within the VTuber fan community.</p>

        <h3>Part of a Larger AX VTuber Experience</h3>

        <p>The VTuber Cosplay Gathering was just one of many VTuber-related events during Anime Expo 2025. The weekend featured numerous activities including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>hololive Night at Dodger Stadium, featuring the first-ever VTuber livestream to and from the venue</li>
            <li>Multiple panels and meet-and-greets with VTuber agencies</li>
            <li>Exhibitions from major VTuber-related companies and merchandise vendors</li>
            <li>Virtual tours of the expo featuring VTubers on mobile rigs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Growing VTuber Presence at Major Conventions</h3>

        <p>The success of this gathering reflects the exponential growth of VTuber culture in Western markets. What started as a niche interest has evolved into a major component of anime conventions, with dedicated panels, merchandise, and now large-scale cosplay gatherings.</p>

        <p>Anime Expo 2025's inclusion of multiple VTuber-focused events demonstrates how convention organizers are responding to fan demand and the increasing mainstream appeal of virtual content creators.</p>

        <h3>Looking Forward</h3>

        <p>As VTuber culture continues to grow globally, events like the Anime Expo 2025 Cosplay Gathering serve as important gathering points for the community. They provide opportunities for fans to meet in person, share their creativity through cosplay, and celebrate the content creators who bring them joy.</p>

        <p>The successful coordination between organizers and the enthusiastic turnout suggest that VTuber gatherings at major conventions will continue to grow in scale and significance. For many attendees, these gatherings are becoming must-attend events at anime conventions across North America.</p>

        <p>Whether you're a dedicated fan who follows multiple VTubers or someone curious about the phenomenon, events like this demonstrate the vibrant, welcoming nature of the VTuber community and its place in modern pop culture.</p>
