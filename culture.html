        <h1>A Beginner's Guide to VTubing Customs and Slang</h1>
        <p>VTubing, short for "virtual YouTubing," is a popular form of online content creation that originated in Japan
            and
            has since gained a global following. VTubers are creators who use digital avatars to interact with their
            audience in videos, live streams, and other forms of online content. Heavily influenced by Japanese culture,
            many VTubers incorporate anime, manga, and gaming elements into their content. </p>

        <h2>A</h2>
        <p><span class="firstword">Avatar:</span> The digital representation of a VTuber that is used to interact with
            their audience. </p>

        <h2>C</h2>
        <p><span class="firstword">Change Form:</span> Used to describe a VTuber changing the appearance or design of
            their avatar, either temporarily or
            permanently. This can include changes to the avatar's clothing, hairstyle, accessories, or overall
            appearance.
            Some VTubers may also have multiple versions or variations of their avatar, which they may switch between
            for
            different types of content or events.</p>
        <p><span class="firstword">Collab:</span> Short for "collaboration," a term used to describe when two or more VTubers
                work together on a piece of
                content.</p>
        <p><span class="firstword">Comiket:</span> A bi-annual doujinshi (self-published magazines, novels, comics and
            other content) convention in Japan that is often attended by VTubers.</p>
        <p><span class="firstword">Commissions:</span> Designed avatars made by a professional based on purchaser’s
            preferences. </p>

        <p><span class="firstword">Debut Streams:</span> When a new VTuber is introduced, they often hold a debut stream
            as their first official appearance. These streams are meant to introduce the VTuber to their audience and
            showcase their avatar and personality. The idea is to build hype around your VTuber model and your streams
            in general so that when you go live for the first time, there’s a crowd of followers ready to support you.
        </p>
        <p><span class="firstword">Dere:</span> A suffix that is often used in Japanese slang and anime/manga culture to
            describe a character's personality or behavior. The term is derived from the Japanese word "deredere," which

        <p><span class="firstword">Doxxing:</span> The act of publicly revealing personal information about a VTuber,

            stream. Overlays are sometimes available through streaming software used for VTubing such as Streamlabs
            Desktop or can be downloaded/purchased from artists. </p>

            crucial step in creating a 3D model or virtual avatar for VTubing, as it allows the VTuber to control the
            movements and expressions of their avatar in real time.</p>
